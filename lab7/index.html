		<h3>
			*The goal of this lab is to get comfortable adding CSS to a webpage!*
		</h3>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> Honestly this lab was pretty easy. Although CSS has a different structure,
		it's a pretty simple formula to follow. As long as your structure is well
		defined in your html, adding in the CSS shouldn't be too hard.  </p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> Does the page have a bit more style? <br>
		Yeahhhh that's the CSS baby! </p>
