				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> This lab was a little more difficult compared to previous labs, but it was manageable!
					I think my issue for this lab was structure, when it came to putting elements
					inside of other elements. I was having some trouble trying to edit certain elements,
					while making sure to not move others around, but I eventually got it all sorted out!
					Going forward, I am going to focus on building a cleaner html structure originally,
					so my CSS runs more streamline.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> Can you tell I used margins, padding, and a border? <br>
					Does the image have an overlay when you hover over it? <br>
				 	That's the CSS at work!</p>
