	<h1> Lab 3: File Structure </h1>
	<p> The goal of this lab is to dive further into creating a local
		file structure on the computer and adding index.html files </p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> The fact that we copied the file structure for the course when we initially
	set up Atom made the first step of the Lab a breeze, since it was already done. </p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> In order to prove I can source an image as well as make a list, here is a
		few screenshots of my endeavours </p>
