		<h3> *The goal of this lab is to get comfortable with CSS Selectors!*</h3>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> This lab was a little more difficult compared to previous labs, but it was managable!
		I think my issue for this lab was structure, when it came to putting elements
		inside of other elements. I was having some trouble trying to edit certain elements,
		while making sure to not move others around, but I eventually got it all sorted out!
		Going forward, I am going to focus on building a cleaner html structure originally,
		so my CSS runs more streamline.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> Can you tell where I've stylized certain apects? <br>
		Does the image have an overlay when you hover over it? <br>
	 	That's the CSS at work!</p>
